"Ok. Here’s your pep talk. You’re not an actor, you’re Jack Donaghy, all right, So quit whining and nut up! You’re right. If you can’t do this you are a failure. Josh can do this, and earlier today he ate a club sandwich with the toothpick still in it. Jenna can do this. And she was once engaged to David Blaine. Any dum-dum can act, Jack, so be a man and get it done."
"Disgusting, sir! Would you talk like that to your mother? Or your daughter? Or your surgeon? Just because my friend is blonde and never closes her mouth fully --"
Then I guess it's a standoff. And I want pizzas for all the hungry people in here!
I'm happy to say that I don't even get that.
"You know what I learned tonight? As hard as you try, no one can escape the horror of Christmas, so it might as well be with your own family. I'm going to go get a bus to White Haven now, and I should be home just in time for Aunt Linda to try to prove that she's sober by holding someone's baby while cooking."
"Hey, buddy. Your hair looks nice. Don't try those tricks on me!"
"Wazzup? Yeah baby! I'm here today to apologize for my earlier comments. I used an offensive term to describe a group of people who made America the great .... continent that it is today. These kickass people have given the world countless, bodacious things like the birther movement, intelligent design, water parks--no, I will not endorse water parks, they are a cesspool of disease and people boo you when you walk back down the stairs. You know what you people have given the world? Girls Gone Wild, the Golden Globes, cans that tell you how cold beer is, Florida, Bratz dolls."
I freaked out and my junk closed for business. It's like Fort Knox down there.
What?
"No, listen to me. Because of you, there may be an 'Entourage' movie."
"Happy Valentine's Day, no one."
Wow. This could not have gone any better.
That's what I said when that hot dog vendor passed out. But you made me go get help.
"And unlike the rest of Jack's girlfriends, I have all my original parts."
What is this? ''Peppy Bismilk''? Why is everything a little different here? I hate it!
That's what you use the jars for? You told me that was sun tea.
"[flashback] [Young Liz] What does it matter? You didn't bring me what I asked for last year you fat fraud. You're a bigger disappointment than our current president, Jimmy Carter."
Don't talk to me like that. You look like a turtle who lost his shell.
I like my tampons to be cold! I'll be downstairs. [leaves]
"No, I'll buy some cookies. But not for Valentine's Day. Instead, these cookies celebrate the February 14th birthday of Anna Howard Shaw, famed American suffragette. Happy Anna Howard Shaw Day to you, Evelyn."
I think it is the most beautiful language in the world.
"Let me talk. I am talking! Will you let me talk? Can I talk for once? You need to call Tracy right now, because I know he's your man but he is my man, too, and TGS is my family, and my family is thick as thieves. [dumps over a table] Now who here wants to teach me how to fight?"
"Well, I'm off. Have a good summer, Jenna."
"As I have told you many times during our relationship, no one gets that reference."
"Yeah, I don't think you are. While stuck in a pile-up on the Pacific Coast Highway earlier, I realized something. You take Danny away from work whenever you want to hang out. I don't think this is about the show. I think you have some sort of problem with the fact that Danny is with me."
[glasses crooked] Hi! I'm Daphne Donaghy! I saw a turtle!
"Jacqueline? Like named after you, like a little Jack but with boobs?"
"Hi. Bianca, I have to tell you, Jack and I are engaged."
Blahh!
"If I have to sit through that alone, I will rent a car, set it on fire, and drive it off a waterfall."
"Yeah, that was super bitchy."

"Yeah, and hurry up, Aladdin. Before Jasmine is forced marry Jafar! [laughs] Similarities... Lemon out!"
"Love is patient, Love is weird, and sometimes gross. Love is elusive. And you have found it. So treasure it. To Grizz and Feyonce."
Yes. There was some confusion and I ended up punching the real Levar Burton. I'm going to get Jeremy. I hope he's not still in heat. He has got my top off before.
"No, you’re not listening. You’re not a good listener."
"Tracy, I need you to do something."
"They don't know anything. Neither does anyone Tracy's close to. His wife, Charles Barkley, Edward James Almost, who is an Edward James Olmos lookalike who Tracy is friends with."
We don't know anything about him. I don't think his real name is Partybot. I don't know what he looks like. I don't know what he talks like. I certainly don't know if he can act.
"Yeah, I did too. I thought the only thing keeping us apart was that you wanted to live in Cleveland. But you'll move to New York for Kaitlin."
"Oh my God. The season's over, why are you losers still here?"
"How about this for ID? I participated in Hands Across America. [searches wallet] Nerds, where is it? Okay. My license is missing which is my cue to go home."
Because my memory has Seinfeld money.
"If you're looking to sneak out the window, it doesn't open. I already tried it."
"I fully understand the irony of what I'm about to say. But I have locked myself in my dressing room, and I am not coming out."
"You wanna party? It's five hundred for kissing, ten thousands for snuggling. End of list."
Are you ok?
Oh. Okay. Great! Fine. I'll solve my own problems. [tries to open door] [finally gets it] Blammo. Solved it.
"Tracy, we've been playing this game for five years now. When is it even going to stop?"
It is not a lecture to simply point out to someone that the episode of Diff'rent Strokes about Dudley's dad has proven incontrovertibly that smoking destroys your health and leads to ridicule from Willis.

Jack. What makes a guy get bored in a dating situation?
"Oh, we're going to have fun. We're going to stay here and make nachos and see who can fall asleep the earliest! Fun, fun, fun, fun!"
"Hi, I'm Liz Lemon, somebody called me."
"Mmm, yeah. I'm a keeper. So now it's a date? I thought I could never be you date, Jack. I thought no one would ever believe it because I'm so grotesque."
"Oh, you stay there. You stay there until you die."
"You showed the security guy your boobs, didn't you?"
"Well, I'm Liz, and obviously my philosophy is simple like a bean. I'm fixing problems in my personal life the same way I fix problems at work. I saved the show, now I'm going to save me. Because Lizbeanism mean that I am a dyke... against the rising waters of mediocrity."
But aren't NBC and Kabletown the same company now? That seems like a pretty big conflict of interest. Why would the government even allow that merger?

"Please, monsieur! There remains, of course, the complex explanation. A vast conspiracy involving multiple agents and precise coordinated efforts. A conspiracy that begins with the timely food poisoning of Donna Straunk. And who here has access to Donna's food."
"The worst. I'm lying to everybody about something I don't even want to be doing. Pete and I keep accidentally touching knees under those little comedy club tables. what is a new cast member? Shut up, shut up, here it comes."
"Oh, Pete, that's later. Maybe we'll be dead by then."
Mine are different sizes. These are the writers.

"No, come back. Aw..."
Thanks.
"You can stay. But if you ever, if any of you ever call me that horrible word again, I will fire you! And you will never alter drapes in Atlanta again, because you do not cross a Sugarbaker woman! I'm so tired. I'm so tired, you guys."
Gross.
"No, no. No you don't, you don't have have to clean me, I'm just saying you may have to clean up after a surprise party later cuz it's my birthday and it's a big one. Blahhh!"
Exactly. So I'm simply going to ask Floyd as a friend and former intercourse companion to do me the favor of not getting married right outside my window. I'm going to meet him tomorrow night at McShanley's for dinner.
What did you say you loved about me? Did you talk about my body? Did you say how you like to watch me dance? Yeah. You like that?
Jack Donaghy?
Astronaut Mike Dexter.
You want me to think of something funny you can write in a card?
"Ugh, Julia Roberts in a movie about eating? Give me Kirstie Alley, somebody who knows what she's doing."
"I'm trying tooooo but I'm kind of locked in, sweetie. The voice is controlling me now. Help me?"
I think it has to do with my issues with sex.
"Jack, wait. Oh my god. I thought you were...."
"Well, for starters, everyone I ever dated in high school turned out to be either gay or a girl dressed as a guy to get a journalism scholarship. My own dad tries to secretly cheat on my mom and I thought their marriage was perfect. And of course there's Santa Claus."
And now a reading from Corinthians. ''Love is patient. Love is kind. It is not jealous. It is not pompous. It does not envy. It does not boast. It is not proud. It is not rude.''
You should kill yourself.
"No, it's okay. I don't want to hurt you. But I'll tell you what I do want. I want someone who will be monogamous and nice to his mother. And I want someone who likes musicals, but knows to just shut his mouth when I'm watching Lost. And I want someone who thinks being really into cars is lame and strip clubs are gross. I want someone who will actually empty the dishwasher instead of just taking out forks as needed, like I do. I want someone with clean hands and feet and beefy forearms like a damn Disney prince. And I want him to genuinely like me, even when I'm old. And that's what I want."
"What's the point, Jack? I'm done. I took the money I was saving for my honeymoon and I bought a cemetery plot. I also joined a book club at the senior's center near my home. We're reading Murder on the Orient Express."
Yeah. Some dude jacked me and now his sperm is growing in my stomach.
My memory has Seinfeld money.
I like bands. Like... Amy Grant.
"You're not even listening, are you? Poop. Monkey butt."
"Dennis, wake up. God."
"You've already made up your mind about this, haven't you?"
"Look, I want you to be happy. And obviously, you have a life to live. But your getting married is a big deal to me. So please, don't do it where I work. And don't drag my best friend, T.V., into it."
"Has anybody seen my wallet? It's an L.L. Bean child's wallet from the 1 970s. There's no money in it, but I was one hole-punch away from a free Tasti D-Lite. Damn it to hell! I hate my life!"
She's your pube shirt.
But that's on A.B.C.
"You're going to juggle them? No, even you can't pull this off, Jack. Mrs. Doubtfire ''shimself'' could not do this. You are going to blow it. And you're going to end up alone, and you're going to have to go to singles dodgeball. Put on these rec specs. This is your future."
The staff moms that are going to be on the Mother's Day show that N.B.C. is making us do after their ill-fated decision to reair the pilot of Bitch Hunter.
"Come on, Sue. You can't just leave me here with Toofer."
"There's a line, sir. I realize you're more important than everyone else on the flight, what with those jet sweat pants."
"What can I say, Jack? I guess I'm getting a second wind here at the tail end of my ''dirty 30s''."
"All right, Grizz. I'm going to speak frankly to you now. And I can do that because of our sexual past."
I want to roll my eyes right now but the doctor said if I keep doing it my ocular muscles might spasm and eject my eyeballs.
"As embarrassed Americans, Jack and I pledge five million dollars to create a new generation of choreographers and puppeteers, clowns, video artists, and theatrical jugglers who will ask the world ""What is art?"""

"Well when you put it like that, with the mean voice and all..."
"That is an ironic re-appropriation. Kch. I don't know anymore. This started as a show for women, starring women. At the very least we should be elevating the way women are perceived in society. Augh my period! You're all fired! [falls to the floor]"
"Okay, very funny. You bought a pager from Dennis. Will you take it off now, please?"
"No, I don't. See you there."
"Ok. I got it, I got it, I got it. What's the difference between yo' mama and washing machine? When I drop a load in the washing machine, it doesn't follow me around for a week."

The simple explanation is that I went to a discotheque and a handsome, interesting man fell for me. In the wake of my breakup I allowed myself to have an experience that gave me reason to be hopeful about the future again. Very simple."

"I was nine years old. I was rollerskating in the house, which was absolutely forbidden. I was skating down the hallway, on top of the world, with my new skates and my new haircut, which everybody thought was a Dorothy Hamill, but was actually a Pete Rose. Anyway, I needed to go to the bathroom, but the door was locked. My recently divorced aunt had moved in with us and I was sharing a bathroom with her. To be prepared I tried to take my underpants off over my roller skates. I slipped, and as I fell I pulled down this poster of the singer Tom Jones that my aunt had put up. My mom heard the noise and ran and found me... squirming under the Tom Jones poster with my... underpants around my ankles. It didn't look good, Jack. She thought I did it on purpose. And she didn't say a word. She just went in my room and took all my posters. Grizzly Adams, Larry Wilcox, Han Solo, Tug McGraw, Mike Schmidt, Kermit, Gunther Gebel-Williams... She took all the people away, Jack! Sex makes the people go away!"

"That's from Invictus. Wait, who was the white guy in that?"
"Also, the next time I see someone throwing a football in here, there will be fines. And... if I see that filthy dog again, I will put it down. I will put it down with a smile."
"Well, I'm glad you're taking it seriously. Although sometimes, when you try so hard to find love, you can't see that it's been standing in front of you the whole time."
You're wrong. I support women. I'm like a human bra. Which is why I want to hire a young comic named Abby Flynn to come on as a guest writer.
"To be fair, I did not think Kathy Geiss was going to finish her song by taking off her underpants."
I can actually feel myself getting sick. Am I the only person who saw Obama's press conference on how to sneeze?
"No. Please, come in."
"Yeah, Chai Boy, get in here. You'll never be.. a millin-aire! Ah ha ha, ha ha ha. Slumdog Millionaire ref. Blammo!"
Yeah.
"I did it, Jack. I got the bag. You were right. No matter how much the gate is strait, or who punishes the scrolls, I am the captain of my holes! Or whatever. We are in control!"
"Okay, friend, here's the deal. My name is Liz. I almost got 1200 on my S.A.T.s. And I need a date for this wedding. And I like your head shape."
Kylie. Great. She can strip her way through community college. C'mon.
"Yeah, well, I hear something else. It's the Hug Plane coming in for a landing?"
"I wrote that, I'm Liz Lemon! ''If your man is over 30 and still wears a nametag to work, that's a Dealbreaker.'' But not you, Mike. That's not you. Mike, leave my cutout alone. Oh, okay. Oh, God. Okay, you know, I'm going to do the same thing to your cutout. Oh, wait, you don't have one, because you're nobody! Ow! Blammo, another successful interaction with a man."

"Well, l'm glad you're happy."
"Yeah, well, that's not going to work for me. Because Jenna is immune to whiskey and Tracy is afraid of juice."
"Oh. That's better. Uh, no. He's a real European prince. Gerhardt Hapsburg?"
"A gay, hipster cop. You're an interesting guy, Brian."
"He is the king now, the old Beeper King retired. Well, technically he shot himself. But Dennis took over, and now he’s the only beeper salesman left in Manhattan. Which is cool. You’re doing the eyebrow thing again."
"I don't know Jack, would I have to wear high heel shoes?"
That’s why you called me up here? Ok. Um. Good evening. It’s great to be here at the beautiful Waldorf Astoria. I haven’t seen this many white people in tuxedos since the Titanic.
I can't let you do that for me. Let him go.
Liz Lemon's got her very own talk show.
A Happy Anna Howard Shaw Day to us all!
We need to talk. Right now. We know that Tracy's not in Africa. He's hiding somewhere in New York.

"No, no."

"What is this, Jabba's pleasure skiff?"
"Oh, actually, I got three haircuts. The first two made me look nuts. Hey, do I say the word ''camera'' weird? ''Cam-er-rah''. ''Cam-er-rah''. ''Cam-er-rah''."
And I don't really think that it's fair for me to be on a jury because I'm a hologram.
"No, nevermind. Lutz, you want it?"
"Oh, come on. I mean, you're not really a doctor."

"No, C.N.B.C. gives me a headache. I get all my money advice from P.B.S."
"Cerie, seriously. take that off. And, you, stop encouraging her. You're an enabler. You need to dress like you have a job. And parents who raised you in some kind of shame based American religious tradition. Here."
"Hey, are you gonna come sit down? Cause they put out lobster tails, and I want to eat yours."
"Merry Christmas, Jack! Sorry, I finished the Oreos in the cab."
"Don't worry, I'll find something to hate. Oh, okay, here we go, this sucks. [picks up menu] This place is called Canal Yards Project? What does that mean?"
"Damn you, Kaplan!"

"Learn from my sexual misadventures, Evelyn. Last Valentine's Day, I watched my boyfriend, Drew's, mother/grandmother die. I met Floyd on Valentine's Day, but he left me for the city of Cleveland. And forget about Dennis. That pervert would always just try to get me drunk."
Why won't they put me on the Jumbotron? I've been doing cool stuff all game. Whoo!
"Stop it. Just embrace the fact that you are lucky enough to be a happily married man. I mean, I'm actually jealous of you. You've got stability, a great marriage, devoted kids. You know what I have? A Sims family that keeps getting murdered. So quit whining and be grateful."

"Don't even bother! I've been on the other side of that door, Jack. You can't outsmart me. I know all the tricks. It's like that movie, The Negotiator."
"We had him, Jack, and we lost him. So Kenneth and I had to spend the rest of the afternoon trying to think like Tracy. I ended up eating a swordfish dinner at a strip club and Kenneth grabbed a cop's gun and shot a blimp."
"Tracy just come back, do the show tonight, and we'll figure all this out."
"So I'm gonna to marry... Yafet. And we're going to live in... Nineva. And I'm going to be a.... prostitute. Okay, what else? What else?"
"It's like, on T.V., it used to be you couldn't say ''crap''. Then, they let that slide, an now we can say whatever we want. Douchebag, asswipe..."
That a boy. That's the Jack Donaghy I know.
It was pretty good.

What happened?
Doesn’t that happen a lot?
"Uh huh. So you're putting one more nut job -- yeah, I said it -- one MORE -- I'm political -- in Washington so you can advance your career? What is going on today? Has everyone lost their moral compass?"
All God's children are terrible.
"Oh my God. Well so I'm glad to see you back. Oh you know, I wanted to let you know there's probably going to be some kind of a party later cuz it's my birthday."
"Well, I met him on K-Date, which is the personals section of the Kraft Foods website."
"No! You didn't! Lutz!? Is that even possible? I mean I was there when he Belvedere'd. God, Abby, you can't be that desperate for male attention."
It's all happening! Hi.
"Well, I really like your hair today."
"Look, Jack I'm not trying to make you feel guilty, I mean, I know who I am. I know I'm not the funnest person in the group. I'm not the one you call when you want to go clubbing on the town and party-dance all night."
"No! People of the sidewalk, we can't give up on the written word! We need stories! Because I don't have a plan B. I have a degree in Theatre Tech with a minor in Movement. Why did my parents let me do that?!"

"No, your honor, I'm not disputing the fine. I'm refusing to pay it. Grenade. Respawn!"
Fine. You don't believe me? I'm gonna go over there. I'm gonna tell her that you just proposed to me. And you watch her. Watch how red her face gets.
Nuh-uh. Wayne Brady has three Emmys. You have a People’s Choice Award that you stole from Wayne Brady.
"Wrong, Jack, because they weren't sweaters--they were dickeys! Happy 2012!"
"Okay, I know that it's been a hard day. I could have had it all. But you had to ruin it! With your thinking! Come on."
